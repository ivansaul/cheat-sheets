This page explains how Cheat Sheets handles user data. By using the Cheat Sheets application, you agree to the practices described in this privacy policy.

## Information We Collect

### Personal Data

Cheat Sheets does **not** collect, store, transmit, or process any personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive user data.

### Non-Personal and Local Data

The application may generate and store data **locally on your device** (such as preferences or settings) to improve the user experience. This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any server.

## Use of Information

Any locally stored information is used solely to operate and improve the application experience. Cheat Sheets does not use this data for analytics, tracking, advertising, or profiling.

## Third-Party Services

Cheat Sheets does **not** use third-party services, SDKs, analytics tools, advertising frameworks, crash reporting services, or external APIs that collect or process user data.

## Sharing of Information

Cheat Sheets does not share user data with third parties. No user information is sold, transferred, or disclosed to any external entity.

## Open Source Transparency

Cheat Sheets is an open-source application. The complete source code is publicly available on GitHub:
https://github.com/ivansaul/cheat-sheets

The open-source nature of the project allows anyone to audit how the application works and verify that no data collection occurs.

## Security

Because no user data is collected or transmitted, Cheat Sheets minimizes privacy and security risks by design. The open-source community may contribute improvements and security audits.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

Any updates to this privacy policy will be published on this page. Significant changes may also be reflected in the GitHub repository history.
