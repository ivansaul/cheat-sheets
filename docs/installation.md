## Android

You can install the app directly from:

[:fontawesome-brands-google-play: Google Play Store][google-play]{ .md-button } [:fontawesome-brands-github: GitHub Releases (.apk)][github-releases]{ .md-button }

## iOS

On iOS, the app is distributed via `AltStore`. Please refer to the official [macOS][altstore-doc-macos] and [Windows][altstore-doc-windows] AltStore documentation for installation instructions.

??? tip "Video Guides"

    - [macOS][altstore-video-macos]
    - [Windows][altstore-video-windows]

Once AltStore is installed, you can install the app adding the app `source` or manually loading the `.ipa` file to AltStore.

### AltStore

[:fontawesome-brands-apple: AltStore (source)][altstore-source]{ .md-button }

### GitHub (recommended)

[:fontawesome-brands-github: GitHub Releases (.ipa)][github-releases]{ .md-button }

??? bug "Open from Altstore"

    Opening the app via the **`OPEN`** button may cause it to not work correctly due to a deeplink issue. Please open it from the **home screen icon** instead. This will be fixed in a future update.
